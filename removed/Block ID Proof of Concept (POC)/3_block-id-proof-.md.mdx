# Block ID Proof of Concept (POC) Guide
It is our understanding that this project is much more than a Proof of Concept. It is designed to be a hands-on, practical exercising of the technology and processes needed to validate the solution will work both technically as well as for the business. With this in mind, we want the solution design to reflect the end-state architecture needed to effectively scale as well as address the unique needs of managing acquired entities.

Together, the entire process of registering and authenticating users will be addressed in a robust, scalable, and flexible manner. 

The solution provides a platform that resolves the root cause for IT expenditure, employee frustration, and large-scale breaches – usernames and passwords. BlockID provides a password-less and credential-less platform that is easy to deploy and intuitive to the user.

Each stakeholder will refer to the **Verification of POC Prerequisites and Installation Inputs** section that includes the following tabs:

1. **Verifying Prerequisites:** This tab comprises a list of prerequisites with steps detailed to verify and confirm each step (for each prerequisite). 
2. **Installation Inputs:** This tab contains a detailed description of attributes and values to enter for those attributes while configuring **BlockID Authentication Broker** and **BlockID Credential Provider** applications post-installation.
3. **NDES Validation:** This tab explains the steps to validate the NDES service connectivity and the ability to issue the certificate on behalf of each user.

This document includes the following sections:
1. List of prerequisites
2. Verifying prerequisites and their requirements
3. Adding values within the input attributes of each installed application
4. Use cases
5. Acknowledgment of POC completion
