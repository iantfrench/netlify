#### The Current 1Kosmos Blockchain Administrator Dashboard comprise of the following components


* * *
:::tip [DID Universal Resolver](#DIDUniversalResolver)
 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are currently being developed by the W3C Credentials Community Group. The DID and DID Resolution specifications are constantly evolving, and so is the Universal Resolver implementation. Understand that everything about DIDs and the Universal Resolver is subject to change at any time.
:::

:::tip [DID Universal Registry](#DIDUniversalRegistry)
 Kosmos - BlockID's Universal DID Registry is a record of distributed identity systems whose aim is to provide a secure, robust and flexible implementation of the DID and Verifiable Claims specifications published by the W3C and the Decentralised Identity Foundation.
:::

:::tip [Transaction Explorer](#TransactionExplorer)
 1Kosmos - BlockID's Transaction Explorer provides the most important blockchain statistics, and other metrics captured directly from online node and is a source of open, reliable, verifiable and objective data about the 1Kosmos - BlockID blockchain. The purpose of the transaction explorer is to help people and companies, who needs to analyze and act based on the information from the EVM transactions.

1Kosmos - BlockID's' blockchain continuously attempts to connect to other nodes on the network until it has peers. The blockchain peers through something called the discovery protocol. In the discovery protocol, nodes are gossipping with each other to find out about other nodes on the network. The following is a realtime visualization of our network of nodes.

:::tip ([NodeStatus](#NodeStatus)
1Kosmos - BlockID's' stats dashboard provides the most important blockchain statistics, graphs, and other performance metrics captured directly from online nodes.
:::

:::tip  ([TrustAnchors](#TrustAnchors)
For an identity to be verifiable, it must come from a trusted authority. Trust Anchors are verifiable organizations that defines the rules that govern the validity of decentralized identities. Trust Anchors will be able to invite other Trust Tnchors in a web-of-trust model. You could use this section of the application to query the validity of the signatures on identity claims issues by the verifiable organizations. This service allows you to search for registrations, certificates, licenses, or permits that a verifiable organization may have, and verify authenticity of each using Distributed Ledger Technology (blockchain).

:::

:::tip  [TrustAnchors](#CertificateDecoder)
1Kosmos - BlockID's certificate decoder can decode any valid ASN.1 DER or BER structure whether Base64-encoded (raw base64, PEM armoring and begin-base64 are recognized) or Hex-encoded. The results on the left tree representing the hierarchical structure, on the right side an hex dump will be shown. Hovering on the tree highlights ancestry (the hovered node and all its ancestors get colored) and the position of the hovered node gets highlighted in the hex dump (with header and content in a different colors). Clicking a node in the tree will hide its sub-nodes (collapsed nodes can be noticed because they will become italic)

## <a name = "DIDUniversalResolver"></a>DID Universal Resolver 
#### DID Universal Resolver
 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are currently being developed by the W3C Credentials Community Group. The DID and DID Resolution specifications are constantly evolving, and so is the Universal Resolver implementation. Understand that everything about DIDs and the Universal Resolver is subject to change at any time.
Example DID's:

DID's and DID Resolution are by definition meant to be decentralized. Under the 1Kosmos - BlockID domain name we are running an instance of the DID Universal Resolver, but you should not rely on this instance alone for DID resolution. From your perspective, you should treat 1Kosmos - BlockID as an untrusted third party that could theoretically manipulate DID Resolution results. Instead, you should run your own instance of the DID Universal Resolver or other DID Resolution tools to integrate with your applications and services.

Tier 1 Trust Anchors (verifiable organizations) List

The 1Kosmos - BlockID ledger is operated by Trust Anchor's (verified organizations), within the ecosystem who have agreed to abide by the requirements in the distributed identity trust framework and are responsible for operating the nodes that maintain the distributed ledger.

Canada Post
Equifax

LexisNexis

Become a Trust Anchor
Becoming a trust anchor would require you to connect your distributed ledger nodes to the 1Kosmos - BlockID chain.

Your node would synchronize the blockchain by downloading the full chain from the genesis block to the current head block, but does not execute the transactions. Instead, it downloads all the transactions receipts along with the entire recent state. As the node downloads the recent state directly, historical data can only be queried from that block onward.

Initial processing required to synchronize is more bandwidth intensive, but is light on the CPU and has significantly reduced disk requirements. Mid range machines with HDD storage, decent CPUs and 4GB+ RAM should be enough.
To run a full node, download BlockID.json and start Geth with:

geth --datadir=$HOME/.blockid init BlockID.json

geth --networkid=15 --datadir=$HOME/.blockid--cache=512 --ethstats='yournode:Respect my authoritah!@[CONTACT US FOR YOUR PRIVATE CONNECTION IP].com 

--bootnodes=enode://a24ac7c5484ef4ed0c5eb2d36620ba4e4aa13b8c84684e1b4aab0cebea2ae45cb4d375b77eab56516d34bfbd3c1a833fc51296ff084b770b94fb9028c4d25ccf@[CONTACT US FOR YOUR PRIVATE CONNECTION IP]:30303

You can download Geth from https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.
