# RADIUS Integration - Temp

BlockID provides the ability for organizations to manage authorization and access to on-premises applications and resources using the RADIUS protocol. BlockID provides a RADIUS Server Agent that organizations can deploy to delegate authentication to BlockID. Admins can configure sign-on policies to RADIUS-protected applications just as they would any other application. 

### About the BlockID RADIUS Agent and Applications.
The BlockID RADIUS Server agent:

* Is a lightweight program that runs as a system service.
* Tunnels communication between on-premises services and BlockId's API Gateway
* Delegates authentication to Okta using single-factor authentication (SFA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Supports Password authentication protocol (PAP)
* Supports UDP, defaulting to port 1812, using multiple ports simultaneously.
