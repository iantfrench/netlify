  "title": "Installing BlockID Credential Provider",
  "description": "This document describes the procedure to install and configure the BlockID Credential Provider (CP) application on your workstation. This will provide users a passwordless user authentication solution while logging into their Windows workstation. On the Windows login screen, you will get an alternate option to log in using BlockID. This allows users to log in to their workstation by scanning a QR code and allows the user to unlock their workstation via a push notification.  In both cases, authentication is achieved by leveraging your biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.",
