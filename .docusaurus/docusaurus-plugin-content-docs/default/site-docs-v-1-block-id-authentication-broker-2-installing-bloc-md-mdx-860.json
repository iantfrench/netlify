  "description": "A BlockID Authentication Broker is installed on a client environment to allow the BlockID Admin Console (running in the cloud) to communicate within a clientâ€™s environment. All connections made by the broker are outbound and there is no need for any inbound connectivity into the company's network. The BlockID Authentication Broker is a lightweight JAVA application that provides a mechanism, communicates outbound only, and handles the flow of encrypted traffic between the Credential Provider (on Windows), Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES), Active Directory (AD), and the 1Kosmos cloud.",
