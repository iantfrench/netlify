# Integration with ARCON

## Overview

This document describes the procedure to configure the BlockID Admin Console as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's ARCON application users. This integration will allow your users to log in to the ARCON account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * BlockID Tenant: If your organization is not registered for the BlockID tenant, visit the **[Sign Up](https://www.1kosmos.com/blockid-free-trial)** page to set up a free BlockID tenant for your organization. The 1Kosmos representative will create a tenant URL, community, tenant tag, and a license key for your respective organization within the BlockID platform.
    *   ARCON application that supports SAML integration running on a Windows server.
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions

1.	With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to log in to:
    * BlockID Admin Console application. Ensure the email address used to log in to this application is the same as the one used to log in to the ARCON account.
2.	Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of the BlockID Mobile Application User Guide]( https://docs.1kosmos.com/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the biometrics enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.

There are two sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:

1. Configure your BlockID Tenant as an Identity Provider (IDP) within the ARCON application.
2. Configure the ARCON application as a Service Provider (SP) within your BlockID Tenant.

**List of Topics:**

1. [Configure your BlockID Tenant as an Identity Provider (IDP) within the ARCON application](#ARCONIDP)
2. [Configure the BlockID tenant metadata](#SaveSAML)
3. [Configure the ARCON application as a Service Provider (SP) within your BlockID Tenant](#BlockIDIDP)
   a. [Set IDP Assertion Claim details](#SetIDPSAML) 
4. [Test the SAML Single Sign-On Connection](#TestSAML)

## <a name = "ARCONIDP"></a>Configure your BlockID Tenant as an Identity Provider (IDP) within the ARCON application

:::caution Note:
The following steps will be performed by your ARCON administrator. Get your tenant's XML metadata file and SSL certificate from your 1Kosmos representative to configure 1Kosmos as an IDP within your company's ARCON application account.
:::

1.	Log in to the Windows server where the ARCON application is installed.
2.	Navigate to `<Drive>:\<folder_location>\ARCOS SOLUTIONS\ARCOSClientManagerOnline\SAML`, and open the **SamlIdpEntities.json** file in the Notepad editor.
3.	In the **SamlIdpEntities.json** file, enter the following details:
    * **IdpEntityId**: Enter your IDP URL. To get the IDP URL of your tenant's BlockID Admin Console, open the XML metadata file provided by your 1Kosmos representative, search for the **entityID** field, copy, and paste it in this field.
    * **EntityId**: Enter your ARCON application URL. For Example, `https://0.0.0.0/` (It is the IP address of the Windows server where the ARCON application is installed.).
    * **EntityName**: Enter the appropriate name for your IDP.
    * **IsActive**: `true`.
    * **SingleSignOnServiceBinding**: Enter your IDP URL. To get the IDP URL of your tenant's BlockID Admin Console, search for the **SingleSignOnService** tag from the XML metadata file provided by your 1Kosmos representative, copy the **Binding** value, and paste it in this field.
    * **CertificateName**: Enter the name of your IDP  SSL certificate for your tenant's BlockID Admin Console provided by your 1Kosmos representative. Navigate to `<Drive>:\<folder_location>\ARCOS SOLUTIONS\ARCOSClientManagerOnline\SAML`and copy the name of the saved SSL certificate name. For example, `1kosmos_SelfSignedCert.cer`.
    *  **SingleSignonIdProviderUrl**: Enter your IDP sign-on URL. To get the IDP Single Sign-On URL of your tenant's BlockID Admin Console, search for the **Single SignOn Service** field from the XML metadata file provided by your 1Kosmos representative, copy, and paste it in this field. 
    * **usemetadata**: `true`.
    * **metadatafilename**: Enter the name of your IDP  metadata file for your tenant's BlockID Admin Console provided by your 1Kosmos representative. Navigate to `<Drive>:\<folder_location>\ARCOS SOLUTIONS\ARCOSClientManagerOnline\SAML`and copy the name of the saved XML metadata file name. For example, `1kosmos-metadata.xml`.
    * **httpPostEndPoint**: Enter your IDP sign-on URL. To get the IDP Single Sign-On URL of your tenant's BlockID Admin Console, search for the **Single SignOn Service** field from the XML metadata file provided by your 1Kosmos representative, copy, and paste it in this field. 
    * **httpRedirectEndPoint**: Enter your IDP sign-on URL. To get the IDP Single Sign-On URL of your tenant's BlockID Admin Console, search for the **Single SignOn Service** field from the XML metadata file provided by your 1Kosmos representative, copy, and paste it in this field. 
    * Save and close the file.

## <a name = "SaveSAML"></a>Configure the BlockID tenant metadata

1.	Open the web browser and enter your organization’s BlockID tenant’s metadata URL in the following format:
`https://<customer_name>.1kosmos.net/default/metadata` 
The XML metadata information file is displayed.
2.	From the XML metadata information file, copy and save the values of the following keys to use while performing the ARCON application SAML integration configuration:
    * **entityID**: The example of its value is: `https:// <customer_name>.1kosmos.net/default/idp1`
    * **SingleSignOnService** URL: `https://<customer_name>.1kosmos.net/default/SingleSignOnService`
    * **SingleLogoutService** URL: `https://<customer_name>.1kosmos.net/default/SingleSignOnService`
    * **X509Certificate**:  
        * Copy the certificate details and save them in the following format: 
        ```
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        Certificate details
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
