# Integration with G Suite

## Overview

This guide describes the procedure to configure the BlockID Admin Console as a passwordless authentication solution for your G Suite users. This integration will allow your users to log in to their G Suite account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * BlockID Admin Console. For example, `<customer>.1kosmos.net/<community_name>`
    * G Suite instance and an account with admin rights on G Suite.
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * Download and install the BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices) on your mobile device. Visit **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID Platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of BlockID Mobile Application User Guide](https://1kosmos.document360.io/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the Biometrics Enrollment process within the BlockID Mobile application.

There are two sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:
1. Configure the BlockID Admin Console as an Identity Provider (IDP) within G Suite.
2. Configure G Suite as a Service Provider (SP) within the BlockID Admin Console application.

## <a name = "GSIDP"></a>Configure BlockID Admin Console as an Identity Provider within G Suite

### <a name = "GoogleSAML"></a>Create and save a G Suite SAML SP metadata XML file
Perform the following steps:

1. Add the following template data in a text file within a text editor:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<EntityDescriptor entityID="google.com/a/<your_domain>" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata">
<SPSSODescriptor protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol">
<NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</NameIDFormat>
<AssertionConsumerService index="1" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
Location="https://www.google.com/a/<your_domain>/acs"></AssertionConsumerService>
</SPSSODescriptor>
</EntityDescriptor>
```
2. Replace “<your_domain>” in entityID and “AssertionConsumerService Location” with your google domain name. For Example,
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<EntityDescriptor entityID="google.com/a/1kosmos.com" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata">
<SPSSODescriptor protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol">
<NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</NameIDFormat>
<AssertionConsumerService index="1" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
Location="https://www.google.com/a/1kosmos.com/acs"></AssertionConsumerService>
</SPSSODescriptor>
</EntityDescriptor>
```
3. Save the text file as an `XML` file.

### <a name = "GoogleSAMLIDP"></a>Add BlockID Admin Console as a SAML Identity Provider

1. Login to your Google site and navigate to the Admin console. For Example, `admin.google.com`.
2. Navigate to ***Security > Set up single sign-on (SSO) with a third party IdP***:
    * Select the checkbox for the `Set up SSO with third-party identity provider` option.
    * **Sign-in page URL**: Enter the sign-in URL from the IdP. For example, `https://<Customer>.1kosmos.net/<community>/SingleSignOnService`. To get the IDP Single Sign-On URL from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and click on the URI link provided in the **Identity provider**’s column. In the **IDP Service URL End Points** tab, copy the URL available in the **Single SignOn Service** field. 
    * **Sign-out page URL**: Enter the BlockID Admin Console’s Single Logout screen URL. For example, `https://<Customer>.1kosmos.net/<community>/SingleLogOutService`.To get the IDP logout URL from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and click on the URI link provided in the **Identity provider**’s column. In the **IDP Service URL End Points** tab, copy the URL available in the **Single Logout Service** field. When a user clicks on the **Logout** button, Google will send the logout response to BlockID Admin Console’s single logout endpoint.
    * **Verification certificate**: Click **Browse files** and locate the certificate issued by BlockID Admin Console. To check the steps for getting the certificate details, visit [Issue Certificate from BlockID Admin Console Application](#IDPCerti) topic.
    * Select the checkbox for `Use a domain specific issuer`. This option needs to be selected when a custom domain issuer is specified in the `entityID` key within Google’s metadata file.
    * Change Password URL: Enter the BlockID Admin Console’s password reset screen URL. For Example, `https://<Customer>.1kosmos.net/<community>/dashboard/user#pwd`.
    * Click  **Save**.
