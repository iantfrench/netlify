## Overview

This document describes the procedure to install and configure the BlockID Admin Console application.

## Prerequisites:
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this installation:

	* Server: Linux OS preferably, RHEL 7 and above
    * RAM - 2 GB (Minimum)
    * Tomcat server - 8.5
	* JAVA version -  1.8.0_252 or higher

## Permissions:

3. Outbound Internet Access and permission to communicate with the tenant URL on `TCP` port `80`, `TLS` port `443`, and `UDP` port `1812`.

## Installation Steps:

1. Place the BlockID Admin Console installation (.war) file on the **Tomcat** server at the following location:

2. Start the Tomcat server. This will deploy the war file successfully.

3. In the **1Kosmos - BlockID - Configuration Wizard** screen:
    * **Server Information** tab: In this tab, the values of the fields will be selected by default. 
        * **Company Name**: This field’s value is `1Kosmos`.
        * **Custom Product Name**: `BlockID`.
        * **FQDN of the Server**: This is your client’s DNS URL.
        * **SSL Everywhere on/off**: Select the checkbox to turn it **ON**. If the option is selected then, all HTTP requests get redirected to HTTPS. If the option is not selected then, the redirection will not be done, and the request will be forwarded as HTTP requests only. To enable this feature, we first need to install the **HTTPS SSL** certificate (this needs to be purchased by the client) on the EC2 instance.

                * Enter `uid` details, if you have selected the Lightweight Directory Server (LDAP) option from the Authentication Source option.
            * **User Search Filter**: `user` for **AD** and `inetOrgPerson` for **LDAP**.

:::caution

## Test the Connection:
In the BlockID Admin Console’s login screen, enter the administrator’s login credentials of the user directory selected in the Authentication Configuration tab of the installation process, and click **Login**. The login credentials will be authenticated against the added user directory details and grant access to the BlockID Admin Console upon successful authentication.

## Troubleshooting Steps:
If the installation is not done properly, you will get redirected to the install screen i.e., the **1Kosmos - BlockID - Configuration Wizard** screen. 

1. Check the **Prerequisites and Permissions** sections to know what resources, privileges, and permissions you need to install the application.
2. Check the logs generated while installing the BlockID Admin Console. The location for the log file is  `/opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.out`
3. Perform the installation steps to reinstall the BlockID Admin Console.
