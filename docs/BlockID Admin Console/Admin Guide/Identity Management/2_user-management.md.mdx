# User Management

## Overview

In User Management, you are able to view users from different datastore sources configured for your organization by selecting the desired datastore option from the source list. You can view your directory tree (DIT) created with different categories of child directories in which users can be grouped as per their access.
After selecting a datastore option, you can click on any directory level under the DIT to view and manage users. The administrator can view or edit the details of any user within the organization, add a new user, and import multiple users at the same time. You can export the list of added users in either a PDF and CSV file format based on the parameters and filters selected from the datastore.

1. Login to **BlockID Admin Console**, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Identity Management** > **User Management***.
