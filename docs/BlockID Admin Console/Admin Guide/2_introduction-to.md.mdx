# Introduction to BlockID Admin Console 

## Getting Started 

BlockID Admin Console is designed to enhance the security of your corporate network and enterprise applications by eliminating login credentials (usernames and passwords) and the need for separate multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions. It is a next-generation identity and leverages biometrics authentication and blockchain technology to verify the identity of a user who tries to access your network or applications. It is a cloud-based solution that is customizable, fully integrated with leading access management, and single-sign-on (SSO) solutions including active directory (AD).

In this application, you will be able to set up, manage, and customize your organization as well as add your clients (communities), set up and manage their users’ identity details to provide them with a seamless passwordless authentication solution.

Administrators with either the "Super Administrator" role or the "Tenant Administrator" role can perform the Admin Console settings.

:::tip Note:
The “Super Administrator" role is held solely by Tier 3 support team members within the 1Kosmos organization.

It provides the following list of segments in which you can set specific configurations within each component for your organization and your client’s organization:
