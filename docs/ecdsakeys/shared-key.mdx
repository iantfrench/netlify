# ECDSA Shared Key

## Creating a Shared Key

In addition to the **BlockID Platform Public Key**, the **User Private Key** and the **User Public Key**, the **[BlockID Developer API](https://blockid-trial.1kosmos.net/swagger-ui.html)** requires certain sensitive  to be encrypted with an ECDSA **Shared Key**. 

The **Shared Key** is a cryptographic key that is computed using the **User Private Key** and the **BlockID Platform Public Key** as input. The **Shared Key** can be created using ECDSA node.js libraries 



Users can generate a new ECSDA **Shared Key**  and view the **BlockID Platform Public Key** with the help of ECDSA node.js libraries created by BlockID for this purpose. 



First, we need to install the `blockid-nodejs-helpers` npm package, which contains all the necessary ECDSA libraries that we will need. 

Open your terminal emulator and execute the following command:


```bash	title="Terminal Emulator"
npm i blockid-nodejs-helpers
```

This will download and install the ECDSA libraries and some helper files containing all the functions needed to create new keys, or to encrypt and decrypt data.
 

Once the package is installed we can import and use the ECDSA key functions by defining them in a node.js project. 


Create a new node.js file, or edit an existing file, and add the following lines:

 ```node title="myproject.js"
const TenantProvider = require('nodejs-helper-files/TenantProvider');

const { publicKey: serverPublicKey } = TenantProvider.getPublicKey();


```
