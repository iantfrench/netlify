# ECDSA Overview

## ECDSA Encryption

:::caution
The **BlockID SDK** handles ECDSA key implementation and is recommended for most users.
	
Developers can create their own implementation if they desire but should proceed with caution.  
:::
 

The BlockID Developer API was designed with a heavy emphasis on security, and features **E**lliptic **C**urve **D**igital **S**ignature **A**lgorithm -- or **ECDSA** encryption.  


### Key Management

When a user account is created, a cryptographic keypair is made consisting of a **User Private Key** and a **User Public Key**. These keys will be regenerated anew each time the user logins to the **[BlockID Developer Dashboard](https://1k-dev.1kosmos.net/devportal/)**. 

The **[BlockID Developer API](https://blockid-trial.1kosmos.net/swagger-ui.html)** also has it's own keypair, but users and developers will only have access to the BlockID Platform Public Key, also called the **BlockID Platform Key**. 

Finally, there is the **Shared Key**. The Shared Key is cryptographically generated against the User Private Key and the BlockID Platform Key.
 

All network requests to the [BlockID Developer API](https://blockid-trial.1kosmos.net/swagger-ui.html) need to be encrypted using a valid Shared Key. 


:::warning 
BlockID Community Administrators do not have access to user key information.

### Summary

To summarize, the **ECDSA** keys used are: 
- **User Private Key**
- **User Public Key**
- **BlockID Platform Key**
- **Shared Key**
