<b>Known side effects</b>
</summary>
<br />
When the “personsPerAccount” limit is set to 1 and the “personLimitRule” rule is set to ‘cleanup’, the passwordless login will happen on the first device (<b>device1</b>) and you can link the second device (<b>device2</b>) using the magic link. Now the <b>device1</b> is no longer authorized for the account, but your login session does not expire. However, once you log out, you should not be able to use <b>device1</b> for passwordless login.
