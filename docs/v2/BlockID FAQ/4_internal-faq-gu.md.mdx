<summary><b>Do we support periodic authentication challenges thrown when the session is active (Example: Hourly, twice hourly, etc.)?</b></summary>
<br />
We can do step-up authentication at a transactional level. As an example: If a user logs in using TouchID and transfers money, the user can be prompted to step up and authenticate using their FaceID. If they transfer money in excess of 1 Million USD, they could be asked to step up and authenticate using their LiveID.

:::tip Warning:

<summary><b>What happens when a GIF with eyes blinking and a smile is used for FaceID authentication?</b></summary>
<br />
It will fail the FaceID authentication. We have a test scheduled with a 3rd party lab called iBETA.com. One the next release is ready we will engage with them and they will do liveness pen-testing. Once we have that certificate, it will help allay these concerns.

<summary><b>1Kosmos will have NO way to log into the tenant's admin page? Can customers completely remove 1KUD once they set up their AD?</b></summary>

Customers do not need 1KUD. They could configure BlockID to communicate with the local AD where they house their user base. 1KUD is for customers who want us to house their legacy users and do not have an LDAP or AD server of their own (or do not want to self manage anymore).
