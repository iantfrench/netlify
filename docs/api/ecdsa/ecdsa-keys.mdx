# User Private and Public Keys 
## Generating a User Private Key and Public Key

:::caution
The **BlockID SDK** handles ECDSA key implementation and is recommended for most users.
	
Developers can create their own implementation if they desire but should proceed with caution.  
:::
 

Users can generate a new ECSDA **User Private Key**  and **User Public Key** with the help of ECDSA libraries created by BlockID for this purpose. 



First, we need to install the `blockid-nodejs-helpers` npm package, which contains all the necessary ECDSA libraries that we will need. 

Open your terminal emulator and execute the following command:


```bash	title="Terminal Emulator"
npm i blockid-nodejs-helpers
```

This will download and install the ECDSA libraries and some helper files containing all the functions needed to create new keys, or to encrypt and decrypt data.
 

Once the package is installed we can import and use the ECDSA key functions by defining them in a project. 

Create a new file, or edit an existing file, and add the following lines:


<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">  

```jsx title="REQUEST"

const BIDECDSA = require('nodejs-helper-files/BIDECDSA.js');

const myKeySet = BIDECDSA.generateKeyPair();
const userPrivateKey = JSON.stringify(myKeySet[0]);
const userPublicKey = JSON.stringify(myKeySet[1]);

console.log("User Private Key: ", userPrivateKey);
console.log("User Public Key: ", userPublicKey);
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP" className="gray-text">
(Coming Soon)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



This will import and define all necessary functions to create a **User Private Key** and a **User Public Key** from the files contained in the `nodejs-helper-files` package. 


We can see the result by executing the file from the command line:



```bash	title="RESPONSE"
node myproject.js 

User Private Key: "XOVjFpBciL3lF/wPIOK1eFX9GMduDoXtXMuzFv0ahxQ="
User Public Key: "V8GgESJHHvcq+migOR8+aDNAK1LZd9FOi0QrBhQ57ZaQb2z1j4fXqBxGLGcwPUzsR4m186nJHliQQ5oW1qyYUw=="
```

The returns an array containing the **User Private Key** and the **User Public Key**.
