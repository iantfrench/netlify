# OTP Authentication

## One-Time Passcode Overview

BlockID one-time passcodes are a great way to add additional authentication to your login experience. As part of your sign-in process, users will receive an SMS message or an email containing a one-time passcode after entering their username and password. Users will need to verify that one-time passcode on your application or website in order to complete their sign-in. 
 


One-Time Passcodes can be sent via **[SMS](/docs/otp/send)** or **[Email](/docs/otp/send)**. 

### Required Information


To generate a one time passcode you will need the following information from your **[BlockID Developer Dashboard](https://1k-dev.1kosmos.net/devportal/)**:

 - **Community ID**
 - **Your License Key**
 - **Your Request ID**
 - **Your Tenant ID**
 

You will also need the following **[ECDSA Cryptographic Key](/docs/ecdsa)** information in order to communicate with our API.     

 - **User Private Key**
 - **User Public Key**
 - **BlockID Platform Public Key** 
 - **Shared Key**

For more information about **ECDSA Keys**, please visit **[ECDSA Key Overview](/docs/ecdsa)**
