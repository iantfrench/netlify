# OTP Authentication


BlockID one-time passcodes are a great way to add additional authentication to your login experience. Integration is simple using our SDK and only requires a few lines of code. 

BlockID one-time passcodes work with all valid email addresses. Phone numbers from US, Canada, and India are currently supported. 

## How it Works

As part of your sign-in process, users will receive an SMS message or an email containing a one-time passcode after entering their username and password. 

Users will need to verify that one-time passcode on your application or website to complete their sign-in.

</BrowserWindow>
 

One-Time Passcodes can be sent via **[SMS](/docs/otp/send#sending-a-one-time-passcode-via-sms)** or **[Email](/docs/otp/send#sending-a-one-time-passcode-via-email)**. 

### Required Information


To generate a one-time passcode you will need the following information from your **[BlockID Developer Dashboard](https://1k-dev.1kosmos.net/devportal/)**:


 - Your License Key
 - Your Tenant URL

You will also need a **phone number** or **email** of the person signing in.
