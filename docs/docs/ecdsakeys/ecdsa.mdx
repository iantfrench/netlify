# ECDSA Encryption 
 

The BlockID Developer API was designed with a heavy emphasis on security, and features **E**lliptic **C**urve **D**igital **S**ignature **A**lgorithm -- or **ECDSA** encryption.  


## How it Works 

The BlockID Developer API and our Node.js SDK both use ECDSA cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt the data that travels back and forth between BlockID servers and user machines.   


### 1. User Keys

When a user account is created, a cryptographic keypair is made consisting of a **user private key** and a **user public key**. These keys will be regenerated anew each time the user logins to the **[BlockID Developer Dashboard](https://1k-dev.1kosmos.net/devportal/)**. 

:::warning 
BlockID Community and Tenant Administrators do not have access to user key information.

### 2. BlockID Platform Keys

The **[BlockID Developer API](https://blockid-trial.1kosmos.net/swagger-ui.html)** also has it's own keypair, and users and developers can access to the BlockID platform public Key, also just called the **BlockID platform key**. 

### 3. Shared Key

Finally, there is a **shared key**. A shared key is cryptographically generated against a user private key and the BlockID platform key.


All valid network requests to the [BlockID Developer API](https://blockid-trial.1kosmos.net/swagger-ui.html) are encrypted using a shared key.
