# Introduction to Athena Admin Portal

Athena Admin Portal is a trial experience designed for clients to experience the world of passwordless login. As an administrator, you will have access to the following core modules:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Directory Integrations | Connect to an LDAP directory to view users and map attributes within LDAP to BlockID attributes |
| Users | View and invite users to enroll in BlockID|
| Applications | Choose from a portfolio of SAML applications to configure passwordless login |
| Settings | Manage your invitation templates, IdP, and session attributes for your community |

## Getting started

### Step 1: Configure BlockID Session attributes 

To enable passwordless login for SAML applications, it is necessary to provide additional context to the target application so the user may be correctly authorized to work within the application. 

Depending on the application, some service providers may require a very simple profile (username, email), while others may require a richer set of user data. Use BlockID attributes to define the data that needs to be shared. 

Currently, two types of attributes exist within BlockID: 

####  BlockID session attributes: 

This is managed by the community administrator. You are mapped with  `firstname`, `lastname`, `status`, `username`, `email`, and `phone` by default. Add any other attributes of the user that might be needed to identify the user.
 
:::tip Attribute mapping
**Note**: As a second step, these attributes need to be mapped to directory attributes to know where to pick up these values.

#### BlockID Ledger attributes: 
Ledger attributes are managed by BlockID and limited to five attributes. If available, these attributes can be returned as part of the SAML response. 
    * device_info (device information)
    * dl (driver's license)
    * aal (authentication assurance level)
    * ial (identity assurance level)
    * ppt (passport)
    
###  Step 2: Manage your email templates
By default, there are two templates available - `Email invitation` and `OTP`. The rich text editor allows you to configure the look and feel of the template to meet your organization's needs. 

### Step 3: Setup IdP Configuration
