# Generic SAML Application

This document describes the procedure to configure your organization's application within the Athena Admin portal to use it as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's application users. This integration will allow your users to log in to their application's account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * **Athena Admin portal**: If your organization is not registered with the Athena Admin portal, visit the **[Sign Up](https://www.1kosmos.com/blockid-free-trial)** page for your organizationâ€™s Athena Admin portal registration. The 1Kosmos representative will create an account for your respective organization within the Athena Admin portal.
    * Application instance. You can use any of your generic applications for SAML integration with Athena. Note that, we have used **Slack (Business+ plan)** as a generic SAML app to integrate with **Athena** for its passwordless login and authentication. 
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit the **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions
* With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to login to:
    * Athena Admin portal
    * Your organization's application account with Admin access.
* Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID Platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of the BlockID mobile application User Guide](https://1kosmos.document360.io/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the Biometrics Enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.

Perform the following tasks to enable this integration:

1. Athena Admin portal configurations
2. Slack (generic application) configurations

**List of Topics:**

2. [Slack configurations](#slackconfig) 
3. [Test the SAML Single Sign-On Connection](#TestSAML)

## <a name = "Athenaconfig"></a>Athena Admin portal configurations

This is a generic SAML application integration that allows you to add your organization's application as a Service Provider (SP) in the Athena Admin console to enable the SAML 2.0 integration and use the Athena Admin portal as an IDP for your passwordless login. It requires creating an SP configuration in the Athena Admin console before adding the IDP SAML settings for Athena within the Slack application. 

Make sure to navigate to ***Settings > BlockID Attributes*** and check if the `username` attribute is added or not in the **Attributes** list, If the `username` attribute is not available, kindly add add the "username" attribute.

:::tip Note:
The following steps will be performed by your Athena Admin portal administrator. The credentials provided during SAML integration are one-time use only. BlockID does not store these credentials, thus it is recommended to change the passwords and revoke tokens after completion of the generic SAML integration.
:::

1. Login to the Athena Admin portal, navigate to ***Applications > Add Application***.
