# Installing BlockID Credential Provider
This document describes the procedure to install and configure the BlockID Credential Provider (CP) application on your workstation. This will provide users a passwordless user authentication solution while logging into their Windows workstation. On the Windows login screen, you will get an alternate option to log in using BlockID. This allows users to log in to their workstation by scanning a QR code and allows the user to unlock their workstation via a push notification.  In both cases, authentication is achieved by leveraging your biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

## Prerequisites:

You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this installation:

1. Workstation: Windows 10
2. Compatible with Windows Server 2012 or higher
3. RAM - 2 GB (Minimum)
4. Registration with the BlockID Tenant (BlockID Admin Console)
5. Computer with two cores

## Permissions:

1. Administrative permissions on the workstation to install the CP.
2. BlockID CP Executable (.exe) file which is `blockIdSetup-<version number>.exe`. 

To get the BlockID CP Executable file, please contact your 1Kosmos representative.

## Installation Steps:

1. Locate your `blockIdSetup-<version number>.exe` file, right-click on it and select **Run as administrator**.
2. Follow the instructions in the Setup wizard. 
    * While CP installation, the **BlockID Virtual Smart Card driver** installation pop-up is displayed. Click **OK** to install a BlockID virtual smart card reader service along with the CP on the Windows workstation. The virtual smart card reader handles all the smart card calls for CP to read the user certificate.
The BlockID CP is installed successfully.
:::tip Note:
It is mandatory to restart the workstation after the installation of BlockID CP.
::: 

3. On the **Windows Login** screen, the **`BlockID <version number>`** option available with the other options for logging into your workstation.
5. Log in to your workstation using your regular Windows login credentials.
6. Double-click on the **BlockID** shortcut option on your desktop or navigate to ***Windows Start > BlockID > BlockID***.
7. In the **Block Configuration** window:
    * **General** tab: 
        * **BlockID image**: By default, the **1Kosmos** logo is available for the **BlockID CP** image file. To change it, click on the **three-dotted (Browse)** button and select the appropriate image file for the logo in the **.bmp** format. This logo will be displayed on the **Windows Login** screen or **Windows GINA** screen. 
        * **Message of the Day**: In the **BlockID MOTD** box, add a message that will be displayed next to the BlockID image. 
            You can also use the following variables in the message:
                * `%m` used for workstation name
                * `%d` for Today’s date
                * `%i` for IP address of the workstation
                * `%n` for DNS name of the workstation
                * `%v` for BlockID version
 
            For example,  “**Login with BlockID - %d**” will be displayed as ‘**Login with BlockID - <today’s date>**’.
      * **BlockID Service**: 
            * **Show service status in logon UI**: By default, the checkbox for this option is **selected**. If this option is selected, the **BlockID CP** option will be seen on the **Windows Login** screen. 
            * **State**: After the **BlockID CP** installation, this service will be available in the **Windows workstation** by default. The default **state** of the service is “**running**”.

            * **Username**: Enter the username.
            * **Password**: Enter the password.

         :::tip Note:
        The rest of the settings shown in this tab are disabled for now and will be used for future functionalities.
        :::
   * **BlockID Configurations** tab: Whenever you are performing any changes in the configurations, stop the service from the ***General** tab > BlockID Service > State > click **Stop***.
     * **Transport Protocol**: This field indicates whether the BlockID CP should communicate with the Console using the **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** or **Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS**). By default, the HTTP option is selected. It is recommended that you use the HTTPS option to be deployed within your environment. 
        Based on the user selection, these values are auto-populated. For example, if the user selects **Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)** then the WebSocket protocol is switched to "Secured WebSocket" and the port is populated to "**443**" like HTTP, WebSocket switches to  **WebSocket** and the port is populated to "**80**".
        

        | Transport Protocol | WebSocket Protocol | Port |
        | --- | --- | --- |
       | HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) | WebSocket | 80 |
       | Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) | Secure WebSocket | 443 |
    
      * **WebSocket Protocol**: This parameter indicates whether the BlockID CP should communicate with the BlockID Admin Console using **WebSocket** or **Secure WebSocket**. By default, the WebSocket option is selected.
       * **Port**: As per the selection of the Transport Protocol, the corresponding port option is displayed.
       * **Tenant ID**: Add the URL of your tenant. For example, `testconnect.onekosmos.com`. This is the **DNS** name of the Tenant for the **BlockID Admin Console**.
        * **Community ID**: Enter the name of your community with which the BlockID CP needs to communicate. By default, it is the `default` community.
        * **Auth Type**: Enter the preferred authentication type. By default, the option added here is `Fingerprint`. You can add other authorization options (Pin, Face, Voice) as per the requirement.
        * **Timeout in secs (5 to 240)**: Enter the time in seconds. This is the timeout setting for how long the BlockID CP will wait for a communication response from the BlockID Admin Console. By default, the value is `45` and it is the recommended value.
     * **Connection Timeout (2 to 10)**: Enter the time in seconds. This is the timeout setting for how long the BlockID CP will wait for a WebSocket connection to establish.
      * **Ping Cycle (10 to 30)**: Enter the time in seconds within the range of 10 to 30 seconds. This is the interval in which the CP will send PING messages to the Admin Console.
     * **Ping Retries (2 to 5)**: Enter the number ranging between 2 to 5. It is the number of times CP sends PINGs and waits on the connection before it is terminated. For example, if it is set as 2 and the CP does not get a response after 2 consecutive PINGs it will disconnect the connection with the workstation.
     * **Custom Error Message**: Add your error response message. If there is an error in the functionality of the CP, this error message will be shown to the user on the **Windows Login** screen. By default, it is set to **Error while receiving a response**.
    * Make sure you have stopped the service, in case you are performing changes. And, if you have made any changes to the settings above, click **Apply Changes**. 
    * In the Settings Saved dialog box, click **OK**. 
    * Navigate to ***General > BlockID Service > State*** and click **Start** to start the service. 
   * Click **Save & Close**.
8. To verify the changes, sign out from the Windows screen, and navigate to the **Windows Login** screen. The BlockID CP option is available with the latest added message of the day.

## Automated deployment and configuration
To perform the automated deployment of the BlockID CP within the Windows workstation, a batch script “BlockIDConfiguration.bat” is available which can be used for either installation or configuration, or both. Depending upon the flags passed, the script can be used to perform a silent installation of the BlockID CP which creates desktop shortcuts for the BlockID Configurator and BlockID RDPHelper.
The script can also be used to configure the BlockID CP by providing the configuration file as input while running the script.

### Configuration file
The configuration file contains the `key-value` data separated by `=`.

Sample CONFIG file content:
```json
CONNECTION_PROTOCOL=https://
CONNECTION_PORT=443
TENANT_ID=abcinc.1kosmos.net
TENANT_TAG=abcinc
COMMUNITY=default
AUTHZ_TYPE=fingerprint
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=45
CONN_TIMEOUT=5
ERROR_MSG=Error while receiving response
PROXY_URL=http://12.12.12.12:8083/proxy.pac
PROXY_USER=proxyuser
PROXY_PWD=proxypassword
ENABLE_OFFLINE=0
TILE_IMG=
ENABLE_MOTD=1
MOTD=BlockID Version: %v
```
Perform the following steps to install and configure the BlockID CP:
:::tip Note:
The flag `-install <executable file name>`should be used when the installation needs to be performed and `-configure <configuration file name>`  should be used to set the registry configuration.
:::
1. Open the command prompt with Administrator privileges.
2. On the command prompt, go to the folder containing the script and installer package.
3. Use the following commands to execute the script:
    * For installation and configuration:
    ```json
    BlockIDConfiguration.bat -install <installer filename> -configure <config filename>
    ```
    * For installation:
    ```json
    BlockIDConfiguration.bat -install <installer filename>
    ```
    * For configuration:
    ```json
    BlockIDConfiguration.bat -configure <config filename>
    ```
    * For example:
    ```json
    BlockIDConfiguration.bat -install blockIdSetup-06.08.60375054.exe -configure CONFIG 
    ```

:::tip Note:
The script should be run after uninstallation of an existing version of the BlockID CP for Windows workstation.
