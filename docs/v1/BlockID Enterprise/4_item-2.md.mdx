:::(Info) ([User Managment](#Usermanagment))
User management provides the ability for administrators to manage user access to various IT resources like systems, devices, applications, storage systems, networks, SaaS services, and more. User management is a core part to 1Kosmos - BlockID's service. 1Kosmos - BlockID provides the simplest and easiest to use user interface tools to help administrators manage user identities including password resets, creating and provisioning, blocking and deleting users.

:::(Info) ([Role Managment](#Rolemanagment))
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC lets employees have access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

:::(Info) ([Policy Managment](#Policymanagment))
Policy management is the process of creating, communicating, and maintaining policies and procedures within an organization. Policies are critical to the organization as they establish boundaries of behavior for individuals, processes, relationships, and transactions.
