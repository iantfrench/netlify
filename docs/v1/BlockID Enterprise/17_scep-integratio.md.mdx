:::tip [SCEP Configuration](#SCEPConfiguration)
BlockID supports the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP). SCEP uses the Certification Authority (CA) certificate to secure the message exchange for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR). BlockID supports PKCS#12 certificate requests as well. BlockID could either act as the root CA or be an intermediary CA. In order to be an intermediary CA you would need to import the intermediary CA PFX certificates.
