# BlockID Mobile Application User Guide
:::(Warning) (Note:)
This document is compatible with BlockID v1.5.2.
:::
            

The BlockID mobile application is a consumer identity management solution that enhances the user experience by simplifying and streamlining registration and login processes while increasing security and privacy and reducing the risk of regulatory non-compliance. It enables a user to log in to your website, online store, or other secure applications by leveraging their biometrics instead of filling out forms or entering a username and password. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID, and LiveID.

This guide describes the  procedures to be performed within the BlockID mobile application.
