# Integration with CyberArk
This document describes the procedure to configure the BlockID Admin Console as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's CyberArk Privileged Access Security (PAS) users. This integration will allow your users to log in to CyberArk Password Vault Web Access (PVWA) application  leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * BlockID Tenant: If your organization is not registered for the BlockID tenant, visit the **[Sign Up](https://www.1kosmos.com/blockid-free-trial)** page to set up a free BlockID tenant for your organization. The 1Kosmos representative will create a tenant URL, community, tenant tag, and a license key for your respective organization within the BlockID platform.
    *  CyberArk PAS instance V10.1 or higher that supports SAML integration
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions

1.	With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to login to:
    * Your organization's CyberArk PAS instance with access to the administrative console.
    * BlockID Admin Console application. Ensure the email address used to log in to this application is the same as the one used to log in to the CyberArk PAS account.
2.	Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of the BlockID Mobile Application User Guide]( https://docs.1kosmos.com/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the biometrics enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.

There are two sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:

1. Configure your BlockID Tenant as an Identity Provider (IDP) within CyberArk PAS.
2. Configure CyberArk PAS as a Service Provider (SP) within your BlockID Tenant.

## <a name = "CyberarkIDP"></a>Configure your BlockID Tenant as an Identity Provider (IDP) within CyberArk PVWA
:::tip Note:
Steps mentioned in the guide are given as per the workflow provided in the CyberArk PAS V10.8.0.
:::

### <a name = "CyberarkWebcofig"></a>PVWA Web Server Configurations within the PasswordVault web.config file:

The PVWA is a web application that is deployed on each Windows server for an enterprise. An administrator needs to configure the IDP details within the web.config file of each Windows server (webserver) that hosts an instance of PVWA web application.

1. Locate and open the web.config file within the installation folder from the default location: `<drive>:\inetpub\wwwroot\PasswordVault`
2. In the web.config file, enter the following details:
    * In the `<appSettings>` tag:
        * `IdentityProviderLoginURL` key: Enter your IDP sign-on URL under the value ="`<LoginURLofyourIDP>`“. To get the IDP Single Sign-On URL from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and click on the URI link provided under the **Identity provider**’s column. In the **IDP Service URL End Points** tab, copy the URL available under the **Single SignOn Service** field.
       * `IdentityProviderCertificate` key: Enter the certificate details in the value section ="`<certificateDetails>`“. To check the steps on getting certificate details, visit [Configure the BlockID tenant metadata](#SaveSAML) topic.
        * `Issuer` key: ‘PasswordVault’
 
####  <a name = "Cyberarkversion11"></a>For Version 11.2 and below:

1. From the `PasswordVault` installation folder, make a copy of the `saml.config.template` file, and rename the copy to `saml.config`.

:::tip 
The default location of the `PasswordVault` installation folder is `\Inetpub\wwwroot\PasswordVault`.
:::

2. In the saml.config file, enter the following details:
    * `SingleSignOnServiceUrl` key: Enter your IDP sign-on URL under the value section ="`<LoginURLofyourIDP>`“. To get the IDP Single Sign-On URL from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and click on the URI link provided under the **Identity provider**’s column. In the **IDP Service URL End Points** tab, copy the URL available under the **Single SignOn Service** field.
    * `Certificate`: Enter the certificate details in the value section ="`<certificateDetails>`“. To check the steps on getting certificate details, visit [Configure the BlockID tenant metadata](#SaveSAML) topic.
    * `PartnerIdentityProvider Name`: The default value is ‘PasswordVault’. Enter the IdP identifier that enables the PVWA to identify the IDP. It is the EntityID of the IDP.
    * `ServiceProvider Name`: The Issuer string that enables the PVWA to identify itself to the IDP. Also known as the EntityID. It must be identical to the Audience defined in the IDP.
3. To support signed requests:
    * Add the following to the ServiceProvider element:
         ```
      <LocalCertificates>
         <Certificate FileName="<local certificate path>" Password="<the password you set for the certificate>" />
        </LocalCertificates>
         ```
4. Add the following attribute to the PartnerIdentityProvider element: `SignAuthnRequest="true"`
5. To support encrypted assertion:
    * Add the following within the ServiceProvider element:
    ```
    <LocalCertificates>
    <Certificate FileName="<the exported certificate path>" Password="<the password you set for the certificate>" />
    </LocalCertificates>
    ```
6. Supply the certificate's public key to the IDP to encrypt the assertion.
To support force authentication, add the following attribute to the PartnerIdentityProvider element: `forceAuthn="true"`.

####  <a name = "Cyberarkversion113"></a>For Version 11.3 and above:

1. Open the **saml.config** file located in the installation folder (the default location is `\Inetpub\wwwroot\PasswordVault`), and configure the value for `PartnerIdentityProvider Name` parameter. The remaining parameters are configured during the upgrade process.
2. Open the `web.config` file located in the installation folder, and, in the `appSettings` tag, enter the value as `Yes` the `UseNewSAMLSolution` parameter to `Yes`.
