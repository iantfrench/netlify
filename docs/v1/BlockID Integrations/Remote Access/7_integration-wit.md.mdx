# Integration with CISCO Check Point
This document describes the procedure to configure the BlockID Admin Console as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's CISCO Check Point users. This integration will allow your users to log in to the Check Point account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * BlockID Tenant: If your organization is not registered for the BlockID tenant, visit the **[Sign Up](https://www.1kosmos.com/blockid-free-trial)** page to set up a free BlockID tenant for your organization. The 1Kosmos representative will create a tenant URL, community, tenant tag, and a license key for your respective organization within the BlockID platform.
    *   Check Point R80 application
    *   Make sure that you have the common RADIUS application UDP port and secret key values.
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions

1.	With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to log in to:
    * BlockID Admin Console application. Ensure the email address used to log in to this application is the same as the one used to log in to the Check Point account.
2.	Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of the BlockID Mobile Application User Guide]( https://docs.1kosmos.com/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the biometrics enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.

There are two sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:

1. Configure your BlockID Radius server within the Check Point application.
2. Test the SAML Single Sign-On Connection.

**List of Topics:**
