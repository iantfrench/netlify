# Intergration with Okta

This document describes the procedure to configure the BlockID Admin Console as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's Okta users. This integration will allow your users to log in to their Okta account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * BlockID Admin Console. To register, visit (link) 
    * Okta instance. To register for a trial subscription, visit [Okta](https://www.okta.com/free-trial/).
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions
* With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to login to:
   * Your organization's Okta instance with access to the BlockID Admin Console.
   * BlockID Admin Console application. Ensure the email address used to login to this application is the same as the one used to login to Okta.
* Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID Platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of BlockID mobile application User Guide](https://1kosmos.document360.io/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the Biometrics Enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.

There are two sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:
1. Configure BlockID Admin Console as an Identity Provider (IDP) within Okta.
2. Configure Okta as a Service Provider (SP) within the BlockID Admin Console.

### <a name = "OktaSAML"></a>Add BlockID Admin Console as a SAML Identity Provider

1. Log in to your **Okta** site and navigate to the Admin console. 
2. In the Okta Admin console screen, navigate to ***Security** > **Identity Providers** > **Add Identity Provider** > **Add SAML 2.0 IdP**.*
5. In the Add Identity Provider pop-up window, perform the following configurations:
   * **General Settings**: 
        * **Name**: Enter the name of your identity provider. For example, **BlockID**.
    * **Authentication Settings**: 
        * **IdP Username**: `saml.subjectNameId`.
      * **Filter**: Use default filter settings.
       * **Match against**: `Okta Username`.
        * **If no match is found**: `Create a new user(JIT)`.
    * **JIT Settings**: Use default JIT settings.
    * **SAML Protocol Settings**: 
        * **IdP Issuer URI**: Enter the issuer URI. To get the IDP issuer URI from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and copy the **IDP** URI link provided in the **Identity provider**’s column.
        * **IdP Single Sign-On URL**: Enter the sign-on URL from the IdP. 
            To get the IDP single sign-on URL from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and click on the URI link provided in the **Identity provider**’s column. In the **IDP Service URL End Points** tab, copy the URL available in the **Single SignOn Service** field.

        * **IdP Signature Certificate**: Click **Browse files** and locate the certificate issued by BlockID Admin Console. 
            To check the steps for getting the certificate details, visit the [Issue Certificate from BlockID Admin Console Application](#IDPCerti) topic.

### <a name = "OktaAddRoutineRule"></a>Add a Routing Rule
Routing Rules allows you to add user criteria based on the user's location, device, email domain, attributes, to evaluate end-users before redirecting them to the identity providers.

1. Navigate to ***Security** > **Identity Providers** > **Routing Rules** > **Add Routing Rule***.
2. In the **Add Rule** pop-up window, enter the following details:
    * **Rule Name**:  Enter the appropriate rule name.
    * **User’s IP is**:  `Anywhere`.
    * **User’s device platform**:  `Any device`.
    * **User is accessing**:  `Any application`.
    * **User matches**: `Anything`.
	    In this, select the required condition available from the list and add value as per the selected option. For example, select the **User Attribute** option and add value as **j.doe** and save. Hence, a user whose name starts with **j.doe** will only be allowed to redirect to your Okta site and other users will not be able to access this Okta site as the **BlockID Admin Console** will restrict access.
    * **Use this identity provider**: `BlockID`.
3. Click **Create Rule** > click **Activate**.

Hence, whenever any user tries to sign in, the added active routing rule checks the criteria and allows users to access the identity provider’s site if the criteria match.

#### C:
* **<a name = "COT"></a>COT**: A Circle of Trust (COT) is a group of identity providers (IDP) and service providers (SP) that trust each other and in effect represent the confines within which all federation communications are performed. The COT is created for each community with the link for the identity provider and entities.
* * *
> [Go back to the topic](#BIDOktaasSP)

#### D
* **Domain**: It is a unique name defined for your organization within Okta which will be used to access your Okta site.
* * *
#### I
* **IDP**: The identity provider here is the BlockID Admin Console. It is a trusted system functionality that allows you to add and manage identity configurations, authentication, assertion, and service URL endpoint details. It lets you use an authenticated single sign-on (SSO) feature across many networks, platforms, and applications within a federation.

* **IdP Signature Certificate**: BlockID Admin Console serves as an identity provider to its service providers to access multiple web and mobile applications in a secure manner. It provides an authentication certificate to its SPs (to add in their IDP configurations) which contain the identity information of the identity provider.

* **IdP Single Sign-On URL**: This is a single sign-on URL where the end user’s login requests will be redirected to this URL to provide login credentials and will be authenticated to provide access to their apps directly if they are authenticated successfully.

* **IDP Service URL End Points**: This includes both “Single SignOn Service” and “Single Logout Service” URLs to provide in service provider’s SAML configurations.
* * *
#### S
* **SP**: A service provider is an organization that hosts other applications or services and would use BlockID Admin Console’s single sign-on feature for passwordless authentication of their end-users. You will be able to import multiple service providers and add their configuration details.


* **SAML**: The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) integration feature allows you to add the identity provider authorization credentials and provide these configurations to service providers (SP). Here, the identity provider is the BlockID Admin Console. It also provides you the ability to import multiple service providers and add their configurations in BlockID Admin Console. This will enable a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's users (who have logged into the service provider’s site) and allows them to log in to their SP account using their BlockID Admin Console credentials.

* **Single Sign-On**: Single sign-on (SSO) is a user authentication feature that allows users to securely log in to multiple applications using single login credentials.

* **SP Signing Certificate**: In the BlockID Admin console, you will be able to import multiple service providers (SPs) and allow them to use its passwordless authentication service. It imports the SP authentication certificate (to add in their SP configurations) which contains the identity information of the service provider.

* **SP Assertion Claims Mapping**: The fields that are available in this section are selected and provided from the IDP assertions claims section. Select the required fields (to be configured with IDP claims and will be overridden at the service provider’s end) to map it to the fields required for the user to authenticate with that service provider.
