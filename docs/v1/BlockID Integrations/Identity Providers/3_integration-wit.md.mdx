# Integration with Salesforce

This document describes the procedure to configure BlockID Admin Console as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's Salesforce users. This integration will allow your users to log in to their Salesforce account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.


### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * BlockID Admin Console. To register, visit **(link)** 
    * Salesforce instance. To register for a trial subscription, visit  [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/in/form/trial/freetrial/).
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions
* With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to login to:
   * Your organization's Salesforce instance with access to the Setup screen.
   * BlockID Admin Console application. Ensure the email address used to login to the BlockID Admin Console is the same as the one used to login to Salesforce.
* Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID Platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of BlockID mobile application User Guide](https://1kosmos.document360.io/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the Biometrics Enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.

There are two sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:
1. Configure BlockID Admin Console as an Identity Provider (IDP) within Salesforce.
2. Configure Salesforce as a Service Provider (SP) within the BlockID Admin Console application.

3. In the **User Edit** screen, in the **Single Sign On Information** section: 
      * **Federation ID**: Enter the email address which you have used while signing up with Salesforce. Also, this should be the same email address that is linked to your BlockID Admin Console's user account.
4. Click **Save**.

* * *
> [Previous](#SFSignCert) | [Next](#SFSSO)
* * *
### <a name = "SFSSO"></a>Setup Single Sign-On (SSO)

1. Navigate to ***SETTINGS** > **Identity** > click **Single Sign-On Settings**.*
2. In the Single Sign-On Settings screen:
   * Click **Edit**.
   * Select the checkbox for the **SAML Enabled** option.
   * Click **Save**.
2. In the **SAML Single Sign-On Settings** section, click **New**.
3. In the SAML Single Sign-On Settings screen, enter the following information:
   * **Name**: Name that will refer to BlockID Admin Console. 
   * **SAML Version**: Make sure this is set to 2.0. This enables by default.
   * **API Name**: This appears by default and it is the same name as your application name added in the **Name** field.
   * **Entity ID**: Enter your custom domain for Salesforce. For example,  “https://1k.my.salesforce.com/”. 
     **Note**: If you do not have a custom domain setup, use https://saml.salesforce.com. However, we recommend first set your custom domain before setting up the single sign-on settings.
    * **Issuer**: Your BlockID Admin Console URI. To get the issuer URI from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and copy the **IDP** URI link provided in the **Identity provider**’s column.
    *  **Identity Provider Certificate**: Click **Choose File** to locate and upload the authentication certificate issued by BlockID Admin Console's identity provider.

   * **Identity Provider Single Logout URL**: Enter the **BlockID Admin Console**’s Logout screen URL. To get the IDP logout URL from your BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2*** and click on the URI link provided in the **Identity provider**’s column. In the **IDP Service URL End Points** tab, copy the URL available in the **Single Logout Service** field. 
When a user clicks on the Logout button, Salesforce will send the logout response to BlockID Admin Console’s single logout endpoint.

   * **Single Logout Request Binding**: Select **HTTP POST**.
This setting is used for Single Logout (SLO) when it is initiated by the service provider.

#### C:
* **<a name = "COT"></a>COT**: A Circle of Trust (COT) is a group of identity providers (IDP) and service providers (SP) that trust each other and in effect represent the confines within which all federation communications are performed. The COT is created for each community with the link for the identity provider and entities.
* * *
> [Go back to the topic](#BIDSFasSP)
* * *
#### D
* **Domain**: It is a unique name defined for your organization within Salesforce which will be used to access your Salesforce site.
* * *
#### I
* **IDP**: The identity provider here is the BlockID Admin Console. It is a trusted system functionality that allows you to add and manage identity configurations, authentication, assertion, and service URL endpoint details. It lets you use an authenticated single sign-on (SSO) feature across many networks, platforms, and applications within a federation.

* **IdP Signature Certificate**: BlockID Admin Console serves as an identity provider to its service providers to access multiple web and mobile applications in a secure manner. It provides an authentication certificate to its SPs (to add in their IDP configurations) which contain the identity information of the identity provider.

* **IdP Single Sign-On URL**: This is a single sign-on URL where the end user’s login requests will be redirected to this URL to provide login credentials and will be authenticated to provide access to their apps directly if they are authenticated successfully.

* **IDP Service URL End Points**: This includes both “Single SignOn Service” and “Single Logout Service” URLs to provide in service provider’s SAML configurations.
* * *
#### S
* **SP**: A service provider is an organization that hosts other applications or services and would use BlockID Admin Console’s single sign-on feature for passwordless authentication of their end-users. You will be able to import multiple service providers and add their configuration details.


* **SAML**: The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) integration feature allows you to add the identity provider authorization credentials and provide these configurations to service providers (SP). Here, the identity provider is the BlockID Admin Console. It also provides you the ability to import multiple service providers and add their configurations in BlockID Admin Console. This will enable a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's users (who have logged into the service provider’s site) and allows them to log in to their SP account using their BlockID Admin Console credentials.

* **Single Sign-On**: Single sign-on (SSO) is a user authentication feature that allows users to securely log in to multiple applications using single login credentials.

* **SP Signing Certificate**: In the BlockID Admin console, you will be able to import multiple service providers (SPs) and allow them to use its passwordless authentication service. It imports the SP authentication certificate (to add in their SP configurations) which contains the identity information of the service provider.

* **SP Assertion Claims Mapping**: The fields that are available in this section are selected and provided from the IDP assertions claims section. Select the required fields (to be configured with IDP claims and will be overridden at the service provider’s end) to map it to the fields required for the user to authenticate with that service provider.
