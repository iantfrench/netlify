# Android
This document describes the procedure to configure the BlockID Workforce Android SDK into your organization's application. This integration will allow your users to use the features provided within the Android SDK of the BlockID Workforce mobile application. The features include enrollment of the user’s LiveID (captures the live (real-time) facial images) details, VoiceID, Fingerprint, and PIN, etc.

## Before you Begin
You will need the following resource to complete this integration:
* Android Studio 4.0 or higher preferably

## SDK Information

### Structure

1. The user app will communicate through SDK via the `Bridge` class. The `Bridge` class contains several functions that do the action in the SDK and return the result to the user.
2. The SDK exposes various interfaces that the user can implement to get responses (success and error) for various actions like face enrollment, voice enrollment, etc.
3. SDK has a class `OneKosmosSDKResponse` which will sometimes be used to send responses to the app. OneKosmosSDKResponse consists of 3 parameters:
    * **Code** - An int that conveys the response code.
    * **Message** - String which conveys the response message.
    * **Data** - JSONObject which encapsulates any additional information about the response.

### Interfaces

1. `ILicenseCheckListener`: Listens for the status of license validity.
2. `IAddPersona`: Listens to the status of add persona call.
3. `IBiometricResponseListener`: Listens for the response of fingerprint verification in devices with a fingerprint sensor. Else, listens to the response of pin, pattern, or password verification on devices lacking fingerprint sensor.
6. `IFaceResponseListener`: Listens to the status of face enrollment and face comparison.
7. `IVoiceResponseListener`: Listens to the response of voice enrollment and voice comparison.
8. `IFCMListener`: Listens to FCM notification received by the app.
9. `ILoginObserver`: Used while QR Code scanning to listen for type of authentication e.g. fingerprint, pin, face, or voice.
10. `IResetAdCredentials`: Listens for the response of resetting active directory credentials.
1. `ITotpResponseListener`: Listens to totp generation.

There are two sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:

1. Configure BlockID Workforce Android SDK within the project
2. BlockID Workforce Android SDK API Configuration

### <a name = "SDKIntegrationIntializesdk"> </a>Initialize the BlockID SDK
Perform the following steps to initialize the SDK within the Application class:

1. The user application needs to have one class extended from the `android.app.Application` class.
2. Initialize the SDK in this class by calling the `Bridge.initialise(Application app)` method.
3. To communicate with SDK, call the static method `getInstance()` of a `Bridge` class. This method will return the `Bridge` class object. Run the following command to initialize the SDK within the Application class:
```json
Bridge.initialise();
```
### <a name = "SDKIntegrationPermission"> </a>Grant Permissions to the BlockID SDK
1. The app needs to ask for Location permissions (`android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`).
**Location** permission is required because the app has to send `latitude` and `longitude` in every API request. If the user denies the Location permission, `latitude` and `longitude` can be `0`.
2. SDK will handle permissions for **Camera**(`android.permission.CAMERA`) and **Audio** recording(`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`). Camera permission is required for Q**R code scanning** and **face enrollment**. Audio recording permission is required for **voice enrollment**.


## <a name = "SDKAPIConfiguration"> </a>SDK API Configuration

### <a name = "SDKAPIConfigurationBaseURL"> </a>Base URL (Tenant) Dialog

1. The app needs to present a tenant dialog to the user in which the user will enter the base URL. This base URL will then be used for calling all the APIs.
2. When a user enters the base URL, call the following functions in SDK to save the base URL:
    *  Tenant URL: 
        ```json
        Bridge.setTenantUrl(String argTenantUrl);
         ```

       **Request Params description**:

    ```json
    generateCredentials(Activity argActivity, ILicenseCheckListener argLicenseCheckResponseListener, Location argLocation, IErrorListener argErrorListener);
