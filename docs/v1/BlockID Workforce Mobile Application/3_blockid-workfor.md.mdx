## <a name = "LoginWW"></a>Login to Windows Workstation 

The following steps are provided for logging into the Windows workstation using BlockID. Before performing these steps, you need to install and configure the **BlockID Credential Provider (CP)** on the client’s Windows workstation. Visit the [Installing BlockID Credential Provider](https://1kosmos.document360.io/v1/docs/installing-blockid-credential-provider) topic for step by step understanding of installation and configuration of the **BlockID Credential Provider** application.


1. On the **Windows Login** screen, you can see the **BlockID** option available with the other options for logging into your machine.

:::(Info) (Note:)
Once the **BlockID Credential Provider (CP)** is installed, the user will see the “**BlockID**” option on their **Windows Login** screen.

2. Log in to your machine using your Windows credentials (username and password).
3. Double-click on the **BlockID CP** shortcut option on your **Desktop** or navigate to ***Windows Start > BlockID > BlockID***.
4. **Block Configuration** window:
   * **BlockID Configurations** tab: Whenever you are performing any changes in the configurations, stop the service from ***General tab > BlockID Service > State > Stop***.
        * **Transport Protocol**: This field indicates whether the **BlockID CP** should communicate with the Console using the **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** or **Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)**. By default, the **HTTP** option is selected. It is recommended that you use the **HTTPS** option to be deployed within your environment. Based on the user selection, these values are auto-populated. For example, if the user selects **Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)** then the WebSocket protocol is switched to "Secured WebSocket" and the port is populated to "443". Similar for HTTP, WebSocket switches to  **WebSocket** and the port is populated to "80".

     * **WebSocket Protocol**: This parameter indicates whether the BlockID CP should communicate with the BlockID Admin Console using **WebSocket** or **Secure WebSocket**. By default, the **WebSocket** option is selected.
     * **Port**: As per the selection of Transport Protocol, the corresponding port option is displayed.
     * **Tenant ID**: Add the **URL** of your tenant. For example, `testconnect.onekosmos.com`. This is a **DNS** name of the Tenant for the BlockID Admin Console.
     * **Community ID**: Enter the name of your community with which the BlockID CP needs to communicate. By default, it is the `default` community.
     * **Auth Type**: Enter the preferred authentication type. By default, the option added here is `Fingerprint`. You can add other authorization options (Pin, Face, Voice) as per the requirement.
     * **Timeout in secs(5 to 240)**: Enter the time in seconds. This is the timeout setting for how long the BlockID CP will wait for a communication response from the BlockID Admin Console. By default, the value is `45` and it is the recommended value.
     * * **Connection Timeout (2 to 10)**: Enter the time in seconds. This is the timeout setting for how long the BlockID CP will wait for a WebSocket connection to establish.
      * **Ping Cycle (10 to 30)**: Enter the time in seconds within the range of 10 to 30 seconds. This is the interval in which the CP will send PING messages to the Admin Console.
     * **Ping Retries (2 to 5)**: Enter the number ranging between 2 to 5. It is the number of times CP sends PINGs and waits on the connection before it is terminated. For example, if it is set as 2 and the CP doesn't get a response after 2 consecutive PINGs it will disconnect the connection with the workstation.
     * **Custom Error Message**: Add your error response message. If there is an error in the functionality of the CP, this error message will be shown to the user on the **Windows Login** screen. By default, it is set to **Error while receiving  a response**.            
     * **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm Configuration**: The **Private Key** and **Public Key** fields’ values are auto-populated and are disabled for modification. These fields are given for troubleshooting purposes.
