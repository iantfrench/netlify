# Role Management
In Role Management, you can restrict access based on the roles defined within your organization. Role assignment will allow access to some functionalities and prevent access to others.

The roles available are already created in the BlockID Admin Console screen. You will not be able to add new roles, however, you can assign necessary roles to the users as per their work profile.

The roles below are listed with the highest privileged access at the top, decreasing in privilege and capability from top to bottom. For example, the Super Administrator will have access to most of the functionalities while the Logged in User will have access to very few functionalities.

1. Super Administrator
2. Tenant Administrator
3. Community Administrator
4. Application Administrator 
5. User Administrator
6. Helpdesk Administrator
7. Logged in User

To access Role Management:
1. Login to **BlockID Admin Console**, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Identity Management** > **Role Management***.
