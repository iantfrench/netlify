# Community Management
In the BlockID Admin Console screen, administrators can add a new community under their tenancy for each of their clients. The default will be created for each tenant. Onboarding a new community (or client) enables the community to leverage all the features and functionalities of this platform yet maintain security by logical isolation of all service components. The tenantâ€™s DNS name will be the same for each of the communities. The service components are listed below:

* Core SDK / Base License
*  Passport OCR & MRTD Code Scanning SDK
*  Driver License OCR & PDF417 Scanning SDK
*  Biometric Face Recognition & Liveness Detection Module
*  Biometric Voice Enrollment Module
*  Identity Verification Services Module
*  Phone Number Enrollment Module
*  Email Enrollment Module
*  Social Security Number (SSN/SIN) Document Enrollment Module
*  Health Card Enrolment Module
*  Social Connect Enrollment Module
*  IOT Device Registration Module

Only Super administrators and Tenant administrators are allowed to create a community. When a first community is configured, it sets up the default authentication module, authentication scheme, a login template, a policy template, and Circle of Trust (COT).
