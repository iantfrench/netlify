# Software and Hardware OTP Support
The One Time Passcode (OTP) authentication module implements two-factor identification (2FA) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) authentication to authenticate users when they are logging in to the BlockID Admin Console application. It provides a higher level of security than the traditional authentication method i.e. using username and password. The two-factor authentication method includes entering a username and password as a first factor and an OTP as a second factor.

OTPs are unique security tokens valid only for a single login session within a defined time. The OTP authentication module includes two ways of security tokens that generate the OTPs - Software OTP token and Hardware OTP token. The software tokens are software applications that generate OTPs and send them to end-users. The hardware tokens are in the form of a key fob that users carry with them.

In the OTP authentication module, the OTP gets generated on the authentication server and on the hardware or software token that the user possesses. If the OTP generated by the user’s token matches the OTP generated by the authentication server, the authentication will be successful and the user will be able to access the application.


**List of Topics:**
1. [Software OTP Support](#SWOTP)
    * [Email OTP Delivery Configuration](#SWOTPEmail)
    * [SMS OTP Delivery Configuration](#SWOTPConf)
2. [Hardware OTP Support](#HWOTP)
    * [Hardware Token Configuration](#HWOTPConf)
3. [Implementing OTP Authentication within the BlockID Admin Console](#OTPAdminconsole)
    * [Configure One Time Passcode module within the Authentication Scheme](#OTPAdminconsoleConf)
    * [Login using OTP Authentication Scheme](#OTPAdminconsoleLogin)

Perform the following steps to configure these two OTP token options provided within the OTP authentication module:

1. Login to BlockID Admin Console, navigate to ***Administration Console > Auth Configuration > Authentication Modules***. 
2. From the **All Authentication Modules** section, click on the **Add this Module** ![Addicon](https://cdn.document360.io/aeae7c88-d2f4-4a9c-bba9-c4f368260d78/Images/Documentation/Addicon.jpg) icon for the **One Time Passcode** module. The One Time Passcode module will be visible within the Enabled Authentication Modules section.
3. Click on the **Edit & Configure this Module** ![EditandConfigurethisModuleicon](https://cdn.document360.io/aeae7c88-d2f4-4a9c-bba9-c4f368260d78/Images/Documentation/EditandConfigurethisModuleicon.jpg) icon for the enabled One Time Passcode module. The **One Time Passcode** window is displayed with the software and hardware OTP token configurations.

## <a name = "SWOTP"></a>Software OTP Support
The software OTP options include **Email OTP Delivery Configuration**, **SMS OTP Delivery Configuration**, and **passcodes** generated within the **BlockID** mobile application for a user.

### <a name = "SWOTPEmail"></a>Email OTP Delivery Configuration
1. In the **Email OTP Delivery Configuration** section, enter the following details to enable the **Email OTP** authentication option:
    * **Protocol**: Select the appropriate protocol type.
    * **Auth**: Select the `TRUE` or `FALSE` option.

    :::
    * **Host**: Enter the host URL `<Protocol>.<Domain>.com` from where the emails will be sent to authenticate users. For example, `smtp.socketlabs.com`.
    * **Port**: Select the desired port option from where the BlockID Admin Console will communicate with the host. 
    * **From Email Address**: Enter the email address from which the email OTP will be sent to users.
    :::(Warning) (Note:)
    This will be a prior SMTP configuration and may vary for each community.
    :::
    * **Username**: Enter the username of the email host server account.
    * **Password**: Enter the password of the email host server account.
    * **Time Skew (in Seconds)**: Enter the time in seconds for an email OTP to be valid before expiration. Time Skew option shows the time allowed for the OTP to be valid before expiration. The default time is `30` seconds. The maximum time is `600` seconds.

### <a name = "SWOTPConf"></a>SMS OTP Delivery Configuration
In the SMS OTP Delivery Configuration section, enter the following details to enable the **SMS OTP** authentication option:
1. **Account SID**: Enter the account security identifier (SID) of your SMS sender service that will act as a username.
2. **Auth Token**: Enter the authentication token of your SMS sender service that will act as a password.
3. **Phone Number**: Enter the sender’s phone number from which the SMS OTPs will be sent to the end-users.

## <a name = "HWOTP"></a>Hardware OTP Support
The Hardware OTP settings include the Hardware Token Configuration section.

### <a name = "HWOTPConf"></a>Hardware Token Configuration
In the **Hardware Token Configuration** section, enter the following details to enable the **Hardware OTP** authentication option:
* **Domain**: Enter the domain URL that is managing the hardware authentication.

:::(Info) (Note:)
Admin access is granted to the community admin on the Onespan server. The community admin can add/remove/bulk load tokens to a user account that is created on the Onespan server for the user(s). In the future, the Onespan function will be embedded into BlockID.
