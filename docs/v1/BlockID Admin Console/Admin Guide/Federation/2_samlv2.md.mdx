# SAML Configurations
The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) integration screen allows you to add your identity provider (IDP)’s information and set its authorization and configuration details. After adding these IDP details, provide these configurations to your service providers (SP). Here, the identity provider is the BlockID Admin Console application. It allows you to import one or more service providers and add their configurations to integrate with your identity provider.

This will enable a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's users (who have logged into the service provider’s site). Thus, you can log in to your SP account by leveraging your biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID, and LiveID.

To view the SAML screen, perform the following step:
*  Login to **BlockID Admin Console**, navigate to ***Administration Console** > **Federation** > **SAMLv2***. The **SAMLv2** screen is displayed.

In the SAMLv2 screen, there is a list that shows the number of added COTs, and each COT has its identity provider and a sub-list of one or more service providers.

A Circle of Trust (COT) is a group of identity providers and entities (service providers) that trust each other and in effect represent the confines within which all federation communications are performed.

The SAML integration is used for configuring settings in the following functionalities:
* [Identity Providers (IDP)](#IdentityProviders)
    * [IDP Core Configurations](#IdpCore)
   * [IDP Assertion Claims Mapping](#IdpAssertion)
   * [IDP Service URL End Points](#IdpService)
* [Service Providers (SP)](#ServiceProviders)
    * [Service Provider List](#SPList)
    * [SP Info](#SPInfo)
    * [SP Core Configurations](#SPCore)
    * [SP Assertion Claims Mapping](#SPAssertion)
    * [SP Service URL End Points](#SPServiceURLEnd)
