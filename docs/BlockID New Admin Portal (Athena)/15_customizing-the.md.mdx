Customize the look and feel of your BlockID login to match the branding of your organization.

  

To get started, navigate to your **BlockID Tenant** or **Community Administrator** Dashboard and log in using your enrolled device.

Once logged in, select the Settings icon from the toolbar on the left-hand side of the page:
