# WebAuthn

## Overview


## WebAuthn

FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn) is a standard web API that is incorporated into web browsers and related web platform infrastructures that is used to securely authenticate users on the web across various sites and devices. 

WebAuthn supports two different authentication mechanisms: platform authenticators and roaming authenticators (security keys). 

Platform authenticators are built into your hardware can often be unlocked using biometrics. Security keys are separate pieces of hardware that connect to your device, such as Yubikeys. BlockID supports both platform authenticators and security keys.   



## Supported Browsers

WebAuthn is currently supported in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari web browsers.
