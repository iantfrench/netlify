## Login with MFA
### What is MFA? 
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or a VPN. MFA is a core component of a strong identity and access management (IAM) policy. Rather than just asking for a username and password, MFA requires one or more additional verification factors, which decreases the likelihood of a successful cyber attack. 

### MFA method 
BlockID currently supports login with username, password and additional factor of One time passcode (OTP). Here's how you can recieve an OTP: 

* OTP sent to Email address 
* OTP sent to Phone number 
* OTP from BlockID app: If you have already linked your device to the user account, you should be able to enter the OTP from your mobile app.
