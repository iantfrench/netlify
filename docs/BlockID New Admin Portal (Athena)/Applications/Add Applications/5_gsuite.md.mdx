# G Suite

## Overview


This document describes the procedure to configure your organization's G Suite domain within the Athena Admin portal to use it as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's G Suite users. This integration will allow your users to log in to their G Suite account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * **Athena Admin portal**: If your organization is not registered with the Athena Admin portal, visit the **[Sign Up](https://www.1kosmos.com/blockid-free-trial)** page for your organizationâ€™s Athena Admin portal registration. The 1Kosmos representative will create an account for your respective organization within the Athena Admin portal.
    * Google Cloud Platform
    * Google Admin Console
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit the **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions
* With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to login to:
    * Athena Admin portal
    * Admin access to your organization's Google Cloud Platform and Google Admin Console
* Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID Platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of the BlockID mobile application User Guide](https://1kosmos.document360.io/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the Biometrics Enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.
