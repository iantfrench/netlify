# Auth0

## Overview


This document describes the procedure to configure your organization's Auth0 application within the Athena Admin portal to use it as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's Auth0 users. This integration will allow your users to log in to their Auth0 account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include TouchID / FaceID and LiveID.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * **Athena Admin portal**: If your organization is not registered with the Athena Admin portal, visit the **[Sign Up](https://www.1kosmos.com/blockid-free-trial)** page for your organization’s Athena Admin portal registration. The 1Kosmos representative will create an account for your respective organization within the Athena Admin portal.
    * Auth0 instance. Visit the [Auth0](https://auth0.com) site for Auth0 registration.
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit the **[BlockID for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.kernel.blockid)** or **[BlockID for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid/id1539421428)** to download the application.

### Assumptions
* With the above prerequisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to login to:
    * Athena Admin portal
    * Your organization's Auth0 account with Admin access.
* Installed and registered the BlockID mobile application.
    * Launch the BlockID mobile application and follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with the BlockID Platform to enroll your biometrics. Visit the [Enroll Biometrics (TouchID/ FaceID and LiveID) section of the BlockID mobile application User Guide](https://1kosmos.document360.io/docs/blockid-mobile-application-user-guide#EnrollBio) for step by step understanding of the Biometrics Enrollment process within the BlockID mobile application.

## <a name = "Athenaconfig"></a>Athena Admin portal configurations

This is a one-click app Auth0 integration that will automatically generate a Service Provider (SP) configuration to add in your Auth0 application to enable SAML 2.0 integration and use the Athena Admin portal as an IDP for your passwordless login.

:::tip Note:
The following steps will be performed by your Athena Admin portal administrator. The credentials provided during one-click integration are one-time use only. BlockID does not store these credentials, thus it is recommended to change the passwords and revoke tokens after completion of the one-click integration. To perform more configurations to the Auth0 SP SAML integration, visit the Auth0 site and perform the changes.
:::

1. Login to the Athena Admin portal, navigate to ***Applications > Add Application***.
